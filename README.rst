Redeploying a service in Amazon ECS causes some effort, even if you just want to pull the most recent image versions.
You have to create a new revision of the task definition and update the service to use the newly created revision. 

This project simplyfies deployments on Amazon ECS by providing a convinience CLI tool for actions, which are executed
pretty often.


Installation
------------

The project is availably on PyPI. Simply run::

    $ pip install ecs-deploy


Configuration
-------------
As **ecs-deploy** is based on boto3 (the official AWS Python library), there are several ways to configure and store the 
authentication credentials. Please read the boto3 documentation for more details 
(http://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/configuration.html#configuration). The simplest way is by running::

    $ aws configure

Alternatively you can pass the AWS credentials (via `--access-key-id` and `--secret-access-key`) or the AWS
configuration profile (via `--profile`) as options when you run `ecs`. 

Actions
-------
Currently the following actions are supported:

deploy
======
Redeploy a service either without any modifications or with new image and/or command definitions.

scale
=====
Scale a service up or down and change the number of running tasks.


Usage
-----

For detailed information about the available actions, arguments and options, run::

    $ ecs deploy --help
    $ ecs scale --help

Examples
--------
All examples assume, that authentication has already been configured.  

Simple Redeploy
===============
To redeploy a service without any modifications, but pulling the most recent image versions, run the follwing command.
This will duplicate the current task definition and cause the service to redeploy all running tasks.::

    $ ecs deploy my-cluster my-service
   

Deploy a new tag
================
To change the tag for **all** images in **all** containers in the task definition, run the following command::

    $ ecs deploy my-cluster my-service -t 1.2.3


Deploy a new image
==================
To change the image of a specific container, run the following command::

    $ ecs deploy my-cluster my-service --image webserver nginx:latest
     
This will modify the **webserver** container only and change its image to "nginx:latest".


Deploy several new image
========================
The `-i` or `--image` option can also be passed several times::

    $ ecs deploy my-cluster my-service -i webserver nginx:1.9 -i application django:latest
     
This will change the **webserver**'s container image to "nginx:1.9" and the **application**'s image to "django:latest".


Modify a command
================
To change the command of a specific container, run the following command::

    $ ecs deploy my-cluster my-service --command webserver "nginx"
     
This will modify the **webserver** container and change its command to "nginx".

Scale a service
===============
To change the number of running tasks and scale a service up and down, run this command::

    $ ecs scale my-cluster my-service 4
